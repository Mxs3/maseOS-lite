# maseOS-lite
Another simple kernel written from scratch using pure Assembly, currently in 16bit real mode.

To build the kernel run 'make build'.
To run the kernel in a vm run 'make run'.

### Requires qemu, however if you want to change the emulator you can edit the makefile to change this.

### Currently a work in progress :)
